#### React
React is a JavaScript library that boasts component reusability and is greatly used for frontend purposes.
For this project, React was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
[More about React](https://reactjs.org/)

##### Start up this project
Running the `npm start` command will automatically start the application and  open it in the user's browser.
If the project doesn't immediately open the application page, it can also be accessed through `localhost:3000`.

##### Run the tests
Running the `npm  test` command will run all test suits in 'watch mode'.
Watch mode implies that when any part of the code is modified, the modified test suite will re-run.

##### Build the app
Running the `npm build` command builds the app for production.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
