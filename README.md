### Description
This is a social media project based on the main features of Instagram.  
This project aims for us to learn the basics of the industrial software development process.
The project was created for the course SOEN341 - software processes at Concordia University.

### Objectives
The app is intended to implement the core features of Instagram, such that the user is able to post a picture, follow another user, and be allowed to comment under posted pictures. The project guideline also requires us to implement additional features.

### Core Features
* User Service (Registration, Login and account management)
* Posting Pictures
* Reacting (comment & likes)
* Following other users
* (other) tba

### React
React is a JavaScript library that boasts component reusability and is greatly used for frontend purposes.
For this project, React was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##### Start up this project
Running the `npm start` command will automatically start the application and  open it in the user's browser.
If the project doesn't immediately open the application page, it can also be accessed through `localhost:3000`.

##### Run the tests
Running the `npm  test` command will run all test suits in 'watch mode'.
Watch mode implies that when any part of the code is modified, the modified test suite will re-run.

##### Build the app
Running the `npm build` command builds the app for production.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Spring Boot
Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a microservice.
It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications.

### Travis CI
Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub.
